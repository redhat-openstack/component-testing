# This file is used by the octario testing framework, please refer to

# about framework itself.

# Dependencies are installed from repositories configured on the
# testing system.

# To easy distinguish between dependencies satisfied by RHOSP repository vs
# dependencies outside of it, those with explicit versions are not available
# in the RHOSP repositories.


# Comments should be put above tester definition, otherwise error will occur.

# Each shell command in the run section/sub-section should end with ';'

# If the list inside [] brackets contains multiple elements
#   those should be separated with ',' see example rpm_deps below.

# Any hard coded install commands that will use pip installation
# method from the tox.ini should be removed, see example /usr/bin/sed below.
# It is because pip installation method should not be used / mixed with rpm.
# In below example install_command and deps are commented out. Those two
# shell commands are duplicated across other testers except tempest, where
# is not needed. If all testers were requiring such commands then that part
# could be easilly moved to run from nova_virt_run_config section and less
# duplication would occur.
