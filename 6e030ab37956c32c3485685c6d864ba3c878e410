      "message": "Package dependencies are not split in sections inside the test-requirements.txt file and I don\u0027t see any good reason to spend hours trying to find which ones are not needed by pep8 and only needed by unit (or any other tox target). Doing this would mean a lot of additional work for us that has no real benefits. \n\nIn fact I am inclined to believe that it does also increases the chances to have build failures due to not-updated dependencies.\n\nIf you are afraid that this increase the build time, let check the numbers: I suspect that installing all of these increase the build time with ~2-3 seconds (in total). I would argue that if we would merge pep8 and unit testing into a single job we would cut *minutes* on build time because 90% of the time is spend on provisioning. A side effect would be less jobs to run on Jenkins so lower resources needed.",
