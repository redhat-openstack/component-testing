      "message": "Nope, because if you check even the last execution the list of files includes files that are only sometimes produced, like patching ones. There are 3 logs that are created only when we test a patch on a component.\n\nLogs are a byproduct of build, not the real result which is usually the result code and the junit files. Even if one logs is missing it will be considered a failure, here is a clear example: https://rhos-qe-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/gate-infrared-octario/190/console\n\nIn fact this line was the primary reason why the gate got broken.\n\nBTW, fail_on_missing default value changed between Ansible versions, now we do control its value.",
