      "message": "Unless you have a clear example where we are forced to use an older version of ansible I would argue that not assuring a minimal version would break things. I am almost sure that it will not work with 1.9.x, Ansible product is quite dynamic and I prefer not to hit again bugs that were fixed by new releases. I think that even before we temporarily added `,\u003c2.2` we had the `\u003e2.0`.",
