I think nose is not required anymore (apart from horizon integration/scenario tests, but then it should be in the configuration for those kind of tests). The other two seems to be available as RPMs in the copr with testing dependencies.\n\nThis should also reduce the need for the RPMs on line 7-16 (libffi-devel, openssl-devel, etc)",
