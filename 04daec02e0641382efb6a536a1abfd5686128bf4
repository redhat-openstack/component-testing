      "message": "I recognise this is not an ideal workaround. For 9 and earlier, Director/TripleO dependencies lived in a separate repository, without this they can\u0027t be installed. It doesn\u0027t seem to cause issues with 10 and later, even though the repo doesn\u0027t actually exist.\n\nmigi suggested using a shell script like in https://github.com/redhat-openstack/octario/blob/master/components_config/12/swift/component.yml#L96 but that happens after the rpms get installed so it is too late.",

The playbook fails with \"I have no such repo file: rhos-release-6-director.repo\" for the case you mention.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to handle this. Would you have suggestions to offer? I\u0027m wondering if I could squeeze an if statement here and only enabled the -director repo for 8 and 9, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s possible. Any pointer would be greatly appreciated!",
