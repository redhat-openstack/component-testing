# This role runs the actual component tests based on the chosen tester

# 'ignore_errors' is true because test results evaultion isn't done here, but in
# 'collect_logs' role, in the last task.
# new line stripped from run command because Ansible unable to parser it that way.
#
# running test commands is likely to produce a huge amount of console log,
# especially on some cases like misconfiguration. We cannot afford to output
# too much on console so we keep full output to file.
